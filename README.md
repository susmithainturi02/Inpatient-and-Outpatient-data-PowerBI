# Inpatient-and-Outpatient-data-PowerBI
I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor patient wait lists in real time, enabling stakeholders to track case types, specialties, and monthly trends. I worked on building dynamic visualizations, implemented slicers for real-time filtering, and created DAX measures to support live decision-making during healthcare planning sessions.
