# Inpatient-and-Outpatient-data-PowerBI
I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor patient wait lists in real time, enabling stakeholders to track case types, specialties, and monthly trends. I worked on building dynamic visualizations, implemented slicers for real-time filtering, and created DAX measures to support live decision-making during healthcare planning sessions.
# Patient Wait List Analysis Dashboard - Power BI Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This Power BI project provides an analytical view of **patient wait lists**, focusing on:
- Total wait list comparisons
- Case type splits (Outpatient, Day Case, Inpatient)
- Key indicators such as average wait list time
- Wait list analysis by **Time Bands vs. Age Profiles**
- Top 5 Specialties with the highest wait times
- Monthly trend analysis across different case types

The dashboard is built to assist healthcare providers in identifying bottlenecks, understanding wait time distributions, and prioritizing specialties with higher wait times.
